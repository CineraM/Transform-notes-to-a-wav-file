The values of R, A, B, C, D, E, F, G correspond to Ab, Bb, Db, Eb, Gb, A#, C#, D#, F#, or G#.

R stands for REST, while A#, C#, D#, F#, and G# correspond to Bb, Db, Eb, Gb, and Ab, respectively.
The last parameter will be the letters q, h, w, e, and s which correspond to durations of 1, 2, 4, 0.5, and 0.25, respectively

After the file is read, it should process the output in the wavefilewriter.cpp
